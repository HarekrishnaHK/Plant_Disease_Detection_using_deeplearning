# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection

A deep learning–powered application to detect plant leaf diseases using **CNN** and a simple **Streamlit web interface**.  
The project uses **DVC** for dataset and model versioning, ensuring reproducibility and efficient storage.

---

## 📌 Features
- Detects plant leaf diseases from uploaded images.
- Interactive Streamlit web app.
- Real-time prediction confidence levels.
- Feedback system to collect user opinions.
- Dataset and trained model tracked with **DVC**.
